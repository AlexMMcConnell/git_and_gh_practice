# My favorite travel experience

One of my favorite travel experiences was traveling to the Bahamas for a week long cruise; the Bahamas
are absolutely beautiful and I'd strongly recommend anyone interested in traveling there to do
so once they have the time and money. The place is absolutely *gorgeous* and it was one of the
most relaxing places I've ever been to.
